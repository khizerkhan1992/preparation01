I had a class of physics in high school. My teacher was really great and I worked hard on it. My confidence level was high and my concepts were pretty clear. In that class, I was that student who used to teach other students and try to clear their concepts and help them in solving numerical. On the day of the exam, I was confident and went to the exam center. I did good, according to my calculation I should get more than 90% but what I got was very low. I got 42% in that class. I think it was some kind misplace of my copy. It might be possible that something happened to my copy some kind of damage or I don't know what happened but that was too low according to my expectation.

I don't give importance to grades they just represent how you did in the course. Your knowledge, your work, your experience, and your critical thinking can't be graded. We grade on the basis of presentation, time of submission, and many other things that can not show how complex you think and how problem-solving you are.

We are living in the where you do need a degree to do a job or business. Even most of the millionaires are not even graduated. So it clears one thing that education or university is not the place where you go to prepare yourself for a good job. What do I think university is a place to explore your field, to do new researches and we can not grade these things. So grades should not be the motivation but learning new things exploring a new world should be the motivation.
